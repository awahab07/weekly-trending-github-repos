## About

This project is a React application which consumes github REST search API (the application fetches and lists trending repos).

The project demonstrates the following capabilities:
- Using latest React version with fully typed React Components and Classes.
- Advanced TypeScript usage for strict typings.
- How a dependency could be kept detached and mocked in tests using a simple class and without using inversify-react.
- An clean, clear, identifiable and scalable directory and files structure. Inspired by [LIFT](https://johnpapa.net/angular-app-structuring-guidelines/).
- Directory structure is kept so that at any point, any feature module could be moved as a separate external standalone package.
- Advanced React Hooks usage for components and material-ui theming.
- Demonstration of how redux-toolkit along with TypeScript could be utilized to yield less boilerplate and keeping feature specific states local to feature modules and components.
- The project is build in a TDD style. The repository's commit trail could be examined to know the top-down approach for tests and a bottom-up approach for refactoring and scaling application.
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
